Testing the ability of the editor to save the page. Send to GitHub and check that the entry was set, and that the slug was correctly applied to the expected folder.

Add a second paragraph for testing.

Updated third paragraph for testing purposes. Confirm that the updated SHA value makes it from the post to GitHub for final authorization. Making changes to test the date-time adjustments. The page should be able to handle modifying the modified date and leaving the published date alone.

Updated again 🙃 🤡
